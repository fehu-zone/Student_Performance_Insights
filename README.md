# Student Performance Insights 📊

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze student performance using a dataset from the Kaggle platform and **after running the code, obtain the clean dataset as a CSV file, categorized and free of missing data.** 🎓✨

The following operations were performed in this project:

1. **Data Reading** 📥: The dataset from Kaggle was read using Python's pandas library.
2. **Missing Data Handling** ❌: Missing values ​​in the dataset were handled using various methods that provide more reliable and robust analysis.
3. **Coding of Categorical Data** 🔢: Categorical variables were converted to numerical values ​​that suit the needs of the model. This makes them compatible with machine learning algorithms.
4. **Data Export** 📤: The cleaned dataset is exported as a new CSV file for easier analysis by users.

This code makes it easier to handle missing data in the dataset on Kaggle and creates a new, cleaner dataset for export. 💡 This is a critical step in data science and machine learning projects and increases the reliability of the results when handled correctly. 🚀
